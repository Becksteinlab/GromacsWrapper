The :mod:`gromacs` package makes `Gromacs`_ tools available via thin
Python wrappers, which are generated in :mod:`gromacs.tools` and made
available in the top-level name space :mod:`gromacs`. The
functionality to generate the tool wrappers resides in the :ref:`core
modules<core-modules>`.

Building blocks to solve commonly encountered tasks related to set-up
and running of simulations are collected as :ref:`building
blocks<building-blocks>`.
