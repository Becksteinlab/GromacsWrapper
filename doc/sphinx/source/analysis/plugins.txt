  Analysis plugins
====================

Analysis plugins consist of a book-keeping class derived from
:class:`gromacs.analysis.core.Plugin` and a "worker" class (a child of
:class:`gromacs.analysis.core.Worker`), which contains the actual
analysis code.

 Plugins

Plugin modules are named like the plugin class but the filename is all
lower case. All plugin classes are available in the
:mod:`gromacs.analysis.plugins` name space.

.. automodule:: gromacs.analysis.plugins

-----------------
 Helper modules	
-----------------

Various helper classes that can be used by plugins. Because they are
not necessarily restricted to a single plugin they have been moved
into separate modules for code reuse.

.. automodule:: gromacs.analysis.plugins.dist
