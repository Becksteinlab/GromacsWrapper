System requirements
-------------------

Tested with Python 2.7.x and Python 3.5/3.6 on Linux and Mac
OS X. Earlier Python versions are not supported.

.. Note:: Python 3 support is currently in alpha state; in principle
  it is fully supported but if you find bugs please report them
  through the `Issue Tracker`_.


Required Python modules
-----------------------

The basic package makes use of numpy_ and numkit_ (which uses scipy_);
all dependencies are installed during a normal installation process.
