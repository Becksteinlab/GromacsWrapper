``pip`` installation
====================

The latest release can be directly installed with :program:`pip`::

  pip install GromacsWrapper

(This will automatically download and install the `latest version of
GromacsWrapper from PyPi`_.)

.. _`latest version of GromacsWrapper from PyPi`:
   https://pypi.org/project/GromacsWrapper/


``conda`` installation
======================

.. versionadded:: 0.8.1
.. versionchanged:: 0.8.3
   Package migrated from *bioconda* to *conda-forge*.

Install as a `conda-forge package`_ with the `conda`_ package manager from the
`conda-forge`_ channel ::

   conda install -c conda-forge gromacswrapper

The *conda-forge* channel should be explicitly specified if you are
not already using it by default.

.. Note::

   The *conda-forge* channel also contains `conda-forge packages for
   GROMACS`_ (earlier versions â‰¤ 2021.x are available as `GROMACS
   bioconda packages`_), which can be used for testing and system
   setup; for running in a high-performance environment you are
   advised to carefully benchmark and possibly compile a version of
   GROMACS_ that is tuned for the system.
