.. versionadded:: 0.8.1

Install as a `bioconda package`_ with the `conda`_ package manager from the
`bioconda`_ channel ::

   conda install -c conda-forge -c bioconda gromacswrapper

Both the *conda-forge* and the *bioconda* channel should be specified.

.. Note::

   The *bioconda* channel also contains `bioconda packages for
   GROMACS`_, which can be used for testing and system setup; for
   running in a high-performance environment you are advised to
   carefully benchmark and possibly compile a version of GROMACS_ that
   is tuned for the system.
