====================================================
  GromacsWrapper --- a Python framework for GROMACS
====================================================

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|


**GromacsWrapper** is a pure Python package that wraps system calls to
GROMACS_ tools into thin classes. This allows for fairly seamless
integration of the GROMACS tools into Python_ scripts. This is
generally superior to shell scripts because of Python's better error
handling and superior data structures. It also allows for
modularization and code re-use. In addition, commands, warnings and
errors are logged to a file so that there exists a complete history of
what has been done.

GROMACS_ versions 4.6.x, 2016.x, 2018.x, 2019.x, 2020.x, 2021.x,
2022.x, 2023.x, 2024.x are all supported. GromacsWrapper detects your
Gromacs tools and provides them as :func:`gromacs.grompp`,
:func:`gromacs.mdrun`, etc, regardless of your Gromacs version, which
allows one to write scripts that are broadly Gromacs-version
agnostic. Source your ``GMXRC`` file or make the :program:`gmx` binary
(for versions â‰¥ 5.x) or all the GROMACS tools available on your
:envvar:`PATH` for GromacsWrapper to find the GROMACS installation.

.. warning::

  Although GromacsWrapper has been used in published research over the
  last 10 years or so, there is no guarantee that any of the defaults
  chosen are suitable for any particular project or simulation setup.
   
  It is **your responsibility to ensure that you are running
  simulations with sensible parameters.** Provide appropriate template
  files instead of the bundled defaults and check the logger output!

Please report bugs in the `issue tracker`_ and go to the
`discussions`_ forum for questions.

Contributions are very welcome --- start by raising an issue in the
`issue tracker`_ to describe what feature you're adding or what bug
you're fixing.

.. SeeAlso:: Other approaches to interfacing Python_ and GROMACS_
             are listed under :doc:`alternatives`.

	     
Getting started
===============
	     
See :ref:`installation` for supported versions of Python and download
and installation instructions. The :ref:`quickstart` provides a brief
example of how to use GromacsWrapper in the most basic fashion.

The source code itself is available in the `GromacsWrapper git
repository`_.

You also need to have a version of GROMACS_ installed.
