====================================================
  GromacsWrapper --- a Python framework for Gromacs
====================================================

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|


**GromacsWrapper** is a Python package (Python 2.7.x and Python > 3.4)
that wraps system calls to Gromacs_ tools into thin classes. This
allows for fairly seamless integration of the gromacs tools into
Python_ scripts. This is generally superior to shell scripts because
of Python's better error handling and superior data structures. It
also allows for modularization and code re-use. In addition, commands,
warnings and errors are logged to a file so that there exists a
complete history of what has been done.

Gromacs_ versions 4.6.x, 2016.x, 2018.x, and 2019.x are all
supported. GromacsWrapper detects your Gromacs tools and provides them
as :func:`gromacs.grompp`, :func:`gromacs.mdrun`, etc, regardless of
your Gromacs version, which allows one to write scripts that are
broadly Gromacs-version agnostic. Source your ``GMXRC`` file or make
the :program:`gmx` binary (for versions â‰¥ 2016) or all the gromacs
tools available on your :envvar:`PATH` for GromacsWrapper to find the
Gromacs installation.

See :doc:`INSTALL` for download and installation instructions. The
:ref:`quickstart` provides a brief example of how to use
GromacsWrapper in the most basic fashion.

The source code itself is available in the `GromacsWrapper git
repository`_.

.. warning:: Please be aware that this is **beta** software that most
  definitely contains bugs. The API is not stable yet and can change
  between releases.
  
  It is *your* responsibility to ensure that you are running
  simulations with sensible parameters.

The package and the documentation are still in flux and any 
`feedback, bug reports, suggestions`_ and contributions are very welcome. See the
package :doc:`README` for contact details.

.. SeeAlso:: Other approaches to interfacing Python_ and Gromacs_
             are listed under :doc:`alternatives`.
