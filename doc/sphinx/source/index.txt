====================================================
  GromacsWrapper --- a Python framework for Gromacs
====================================================

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|


**GromacsWrapper** is a Python package (Python 2.7.x and Python ≥ 3.6)
that wraps system calls to Gromacs_ tools into thin classes. This
allows for fairly seamless integration of the gromacs tools into
Python_ scripts. This is generally superior to shell scripts because
of Python's better error handling and superior data structures. It
also allows for modularization and code re-use. In addition, commands,
warnings and errors are logged to a file so that there exists a
complete history of what has been done.

Gromacs_ versions 4.6.x, 2016.x, 2018.x, 2019.x, 2020.x, and 2021.x are all
supported. GromacsWrapper detects your Gromacs tools and provides them
as :func:`gromacs.grompp`, :func:`gromacs.mdrun`, etc, regardless of
your Gromacs version, which allows one to write scripts that are
broadly Gromacs-version agnostic. Source your ``GMXRC`` file or make
the :program:`gmx` binary (for versions ≥ 5.x) or all the Gromacs
tools available on your :envvar:`PATH` for GromacsWrapper to find the
Gromacs installation.

.. warning::

  Although GromacsWrapper has been used in published research over the
  last 10 years or so, there is no guarantee that any of the defaults
  chosen are suitable for any particular project or simulation setup.
   
  It is **your responsibility to ensure that you are running
  simulations with sensible parameters.** Provide appropriate template
  files instead of the bundled defaults and check the logger output!

Any `feedback, bug reports, suggestions`_ and contributions are very
welcome.

.. SeeAlso:: Other approaches to interfacing Python_ and Gromacs_
             are listed under :doc:`alternatives`.

	     
Getting started
===============
	     
See :ref:`installation` for download and installation instructions. The
:ref:`quickstart` provides a brief example of how to use
GromacsWrapper in the most basic fashion.

The source code itself is available in the `GromacsWrapper git
repository`_.

You also need to have a version of Gromacs_ installed.
