 README: GromacsWrapper
========================

|build| |cov| |docs| |zenodo| 

A primitive wrapper around the Gromacs tools until we have proper
python bindings. It also provides a small library (cook book) of
often-used recipes and helper functions to set up MD simulations.

`Documentation`_ is mostly provided through the python doc strings and
available at http://gromacswrapper.readthedocs.org for recent releases.

The source code is available in the `GromacsWrapper git repository`_.

Please be aware that this is **alpha** software that most definitely
contains bugs. It is *your* responsibility to ensure that you are
running simulations with sensible parameters.
