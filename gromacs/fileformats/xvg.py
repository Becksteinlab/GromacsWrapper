Simple xmgrace XVG file format
==============================

Gromacs produces graphs in the `xmgrace`_ ("xvg") format. These are
simple multi-column data files. The class :class:`XVG` encapsulates
access to such files and adds a number of methods to access the data
(as NumPy arrays), compute aggregates, or quickly plot it.

.. _xmgrace: http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace/

The :class:`XVG` class is useful beyond reading xvg files. With the
*array* keyword or the :meth:`XVG.set` method one can load data from
an array instead of a file. The array should be simple "NXY" data
(typically: first column time or position, further columns scalar
observables). The data should be a NumPy :class:`numpy.ndarray` array
``a`` with :attr:`~numpy.ndarray.shape` ``(M, N)`` where *M*-1 is the
number of observables and *N* the number of observations, e.g.the
number of time points in a time series. ``a[0]`` is the time or
position and ``a[1:]`` the *M*-1 data columns.


Errors
------

The :attr:`XVG.error` attribute contains the statistical error for
each timeseries. It is computed from the standard deviation of the
fluctuations from the mean and their correlation time. The parameters
for the calculations of the correlation time are set with
:meth:`XVG.set_correlparameters`.

.. SeeAlso:: :func:`numkit.timeseries.tcorrel`


Plotting
--------

The :meth:`XVG.plot` and :meth:`XVG.errorbar` methods are set up to
produce graphs of multiple columns simultaneously. It is
typically assumed that the first column in the selected (sub)array
contains the abscissa ("x-axis") of the graph and all further columns
are plotted against the first one.

Data selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Plotting from :class:`XVG` is fairly flexible as one can always pass
the *columns* keyword to select which columns are to be
plotted. Assuming that the data contains ``[t, X1, X2, X3]``, then one
can

1) plot all observable columns (X1 to X3) against t::

     xvg.plot()

2) plot only X2 against t::

     xvg.plot(columns=[0,2])

3) plot X2 and X3 against t::

     xvg.plot(columns=[0,2,3])

4) plot X1 against X3::

     xvg.plot(columns=[2,3])


Coarse grainining of data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is also possible to *coarse grain the data* for plotting (which
typically results in visually smoothing the graph because noise is
averaged out).

Currently, two alternative algorithms to produce "coarse grained"
(decimated) graphs are implemented and can be selected with the
*method* keyword for the plotting functions in conjuction with
*maxpoints* (the number of points to be plotted):

1) **mean** histogram (default) --- bin the data (using
   :func:`numkit.timeseries.regularized_function` and compute the
   mean for each bin. Gives the exact number of desired points
   but the time data are whatever the middle of the bin is.

2) **smooth** subsampled --- smooth the data with a running average
   (other windows like Hamming are also possible) and then pick data
   points at a stepsize compatible with the number of data points
   required. Will give exact times but not the exact number of data
   points.

For simple test data, both approaches give very similar output.

For the special case of periodic data such as angles, one can use the
circular mean ("circmean") to coarse grain. In this case, jumps across
the -180ยบ/+180ยบ boundary are added as masked datapoints and no line is
drawn across the jump in the plot. (Only works with the simple
:meth:`XVG.plot` method at the moment, errorbars or range plots are
not implemented yet.)

.. SeeAlso:: :meth:`XVG.decimate`

Examples
--------

In this example we generate a noisy time series of a sine wave. We
store the time, the value, and an error. (In a real example, the
value might be the mean over multiple observations and the error might
be the estimated error of the mean.)

  >>> import numpy as np
  >>> import gromacs.formats
  >>> X = np.linspace(-10,10,50000)
  >>> yerr = np.random.randn(len(X))*0.05
  >>> data = np.vstack((X, np.sin(X) + yerr, np.random.randn(len(X))*0.05))
  >>> xvg = gromacs.formats.XVG(array=data)

Plot value for *all* time points::

  >>> xvg.plot(columns=[0,1], maxpoints=None, color="black", alpha=0.2)

Plot bin-averaged (decimated) data with the errors, over 1000 points::

  >>> xvg.errorbar(maxpoints=1000, color="red")

(see output in Figure :ref:`Plot of Raw vs Decimated data <figure-xvg-decimated-label>`)

.. _figure-xvg-decimated-label:

.. figure:: xvg_decimated.*
   :figwidth: 40%
   :scale: 70%
   :alt: plot of a raw noisy sin(x) graph versus its decimated version
   :align: right

   **Plot of Raw vs Decimated data.** Example of plotting raw data
   (sine on 50,000 points, gray) versus the decimated graph (reduced
   to 1000 points, red line). The errors were also decimated and
   reduced to the errors within the 5% and the 95% percentile. The
   decimation is carried out by histogramming the data in the desired
   number of bins and then the data in each bin is reduced by either
   :func:`numpy.mean` (for the value) or
   :func:`scipy.stats.scoreatpercentile` (for errors).

In principle it is possible to use other functions to decimate the
data. For :meth:`XVG.plot`, the *method* keyword can be changed (see
:meth:`XVG.decimate` for allowed *method* values). For
:meth:`XVG.errorbar`, the method to reduce the data values (typically
column 1) is fixed to "mean" but the errors (typically columns 2 and 3)
can also be reduced with *error_method* = "rms".

If one wants to show the variation of the raw data together with the
decimated and smoothed data then one can plot the percentiles of the
deviation from the mean in each bin:

   >>> xvg.errorbar(columns=[0,1,1], maxpoints=1000, color="blue", demean=True)

The *demean* keyword indicates if fluctuations from the mean are
regularised [#demean]_. The method :meth:`XVG.plot_coarsened`
automates this approach and can plot coarsened data selected by the
*columns* keyword.

.. rubric:: Footnotes

.. [#demean] When *error_method* = "percentile" is selected for
             :meth:`XVG.errorbar` then *demean* does not actually
             force a regularisation of the fluctuations from the
             mean. Instead, the (symmetric) percentiles are computed
             on the full data and the error ranges for plotting are
             directly set to the percentiles. In this way one can
             easily plot the e.g. 10th-percentile to 90th-percentile
             band (using keyword *percentile* = 10).

    the association between file and instance.

    unparseable lines. In this case the line numbers of the skipped lines are stored
    in :attr:`XVG.corrupted_lineno`.

    A number of attributes are defined to give quick access to simple statistics such as

     - :attr:`~XVG.mean`: mean of all data columns

     - :attr:`~XVG.min`: minimum of data
